Your models are well-structured, but there might be a few areas where you could enhance or clarify the relationships between the entities. Below are some suggestions and points to consider:

1. Event Model Enhancements
isBooked Field: This field might be unnecessary since bookings are likely tracked in the Booking model. If an event can be booked multiple times by different users, it’s better to handle the booked status dynamically rather than storing it in the Event schema.
Capacity: If events have a limited number of seats, consider adding a capacity field to track the total number of seats available for the event.
typescript
Copy code
const eventSchema = new Schema<EventSchema, Model<EventSchema>>(
  {
    title: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    description: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    price: {
      type: Number,
      required: true,
    },
    owner: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "User",
    },
    location: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    eventDate: {
      type: Date,
      required: true,
    },
    capacity: {
      type: Number,
      required: true,
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true },
);

const eventModel = model<EventSchema>("Event", eventSchema);
export { eventModel };
2. Booking Model Enhancements
events Array: If a booking is intended to be for a single event, consider changing this to a single event field instead of an array.
Seats per Event: If each event has different seats, ensure the seats array references seats associated with the specific event.
Booking Status: Add a status field to track the booking status (e.g., confirmed, pending, canceled).
typescript
Copy code
const bookingSchema = new Schema(
  {
    user: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "User",
      required: true,
    },
    event: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "Event",
      required: true,
    },
    seats: {
      type: [
        {
          type: Types.ObjectId,
          ref: "Seat",
        },
      ],
      default: [],
    },
    status: {
      type: String,
      enum: ['confirmed', 'pending', 'canceled'],
      default: 'pending',
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true },
);

export const bookingModel = model("Booking", bookingSchema);
3. Seat Model Enhancements
Seat Numbering: Ensure that seat numbers are unique per event. You may want to consider a compound index or a separate seatMap schema.
isBooked Status: Similar to the Event model, the isBooked status should reflect the actual bookings.
typescript
Copy code
const seatSchema = new Schema(
  {
    event: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'Event',
      required: true,
    },
    seatNumber: {
      type: Number,
      required: true,
    },
    reservedBy: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User',
    },
    isBooked: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: false,
    },
  },
  { 
    timestamps: true,
    // Ensure seat numbers are unique per event
    unique: ['event', 'seatNumber']
  }
);

const seatModel = model('Seat', seatSchema);
export { seatModel };
4. Relationships Between Models
Cascading Deletes: Consider whether deleting an event should also delete associated bookings and seats. Mongoose's pre middleware can help with this.
Booking Logic: Implement logic in your service layer to ensure that when a seat is booked, it’s marked as isBooked and associated with the correct booking.
Example of Cascading Deletes:
typescript
Copy code
// In Event Schema
eventSchema.pre('remove', async function(next) {
  await bookingModel.deleteMany({ event: this._id });
  await seatModel.deleteMany({ event: this._id });
  next();
});
Summary
Ensure Unique Constraints: Make sure that seat numbers are unique per event.
Status Fields: Use status fields in bookings and seats to track the real-time state of each entity.
Relationships and Dependencies: Carefully define relationships and consider cascading operations.
Feel free to modify these suggestions based on your application's specific needs! If you have any further questions or need more guidance, feel free to ask.

How to handle reservations?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Handling reservations in your event booking API involves ensuring that seats are properly reserved, booked, and managed to avoid overbooking and conflicts. Below is a comprehensive approach to handle reservations effectively:

1. Reservation Flow
User Selects Seats: The user selects one or more seats to reserve for a specific event.
Check Availability: Before confirming the reservation, the system checks if the selected seats are available (not already booked or reserved by someone else).
Reserve the Seats: If available, the seats are temporarily reserved for a short period (e.g., 5-10 minutes) while the user completes the booking process.
Complete Booking: If the user successfully completes the booking within the reservation period, the seats are marked as booked.
Handle Expiration: If the user does not complete the booking in time, the reservation expires, and the seats become available again.
2. Models Modifications
Seat Schema:
Add a reservedAt field to track when a seat was reserved, and a reservationExpiresAt field to track when the reservation should expire.

typescript
Copy code
const seatSchema = new Schema(
  {
    event: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'Event',
      required: true,
    },
    seatNumber: {
      type: Number,
      required: true,
    },
    reservedBy: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User',
    },
    reservedAt: {
      type: Date,
    },
    reservationExpiresAt: {
      type: Date,
    },
    isBooked: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: false,
    },
  },
  {
    timestamps: true,
    unique: ['event', 'seatNumber'], // Ensure seat numbers are unique per event
  }
);

const seatModel = model('Seat', seatSchema);
export { seatModel };
Booking Schema:
You don't need to change much here, but ensure that bookings are only confirmed if the seats are still reserved for the user.

3. Reservation Logic
Reserve Seats:
Create a function to reserve seats temporarily.

typescript
Copy code
async function reserveSeats(eventId, seatNumbers, userId, reservationDuration = 10 * 60 * 1000) {
  const now = new Date();
  const expiresAt = new Date(now.getTime() + reservationDuration);

  const seats = await seatModel.find({
    event: eventId,
    seatNumber: { $in: seatNumbers },
    isBooked: false,
    $or: [
      { reservedAt: { $exists: false } },
      { reservationExpiresAt: { $lt: now } },
    ],
  });

  if (seats.length !== seatNumbers.length) {
    throw new Error("Some seats are already reserved or booked.");
  }

  await seatModel.updateMany(
    { _id: { $in: seats.map(seat => seat._id) } },
    {
      reservedBy: userId,
      reservedAt: now,
      reservationExpiresAt: expiresAt,
    }
  );

  return seats;
}
Confirm Booking:
Create a function to confirm the booking.

typescript
Copy code
async function confirmBooking(eventId, seatNumbers, userId) {
  const now = new Date();

  const seats = await seatModel.find({
    event: eventId,
    seatNumber: { $in: seatNumbers },
    reservedBy: userId,
    reservationExpiresAt: { $gt: now },
    isBooked: false,
  });

  if (seats.length !== seatNumbers.length) {
    throw new Error("Some seats are no longer available.");
  }

  await seatModel.updateMany(
    { _id: { $in: seats.map(seat => seat._id) } },
    {
      isBooked: true,
      reservedBy: null,
      reservedAt: null,
      reservationExpiresAt: null,
    }
  );

  const booking = new bookingModel({
    user: userId,
    event: eventId,
    seats: seats.map(seat => seat._id),
    status: 'confirmed',
  });

  await booking.save();

  return booking;
}
Handle Expired Reservations:
Run a periodic task to clear expired reservations.

typescript
Copy code
async function clearExpiredReservations() {
  const now = new Date();

  await seatModel.updateMany(
    { reservationExpiresAt: { $lt: now }, isBooked: false },
    {
      reservedBy: null,
      reservedAt: null,
      reservationExpiresAt: null,
    }
  );
}

// Call this function periodically, e.g., every minute
setInterval(clearExpiredReservations, 60 * 1000);
4. API Endpoints
Reserve Seats: An endpoint to handle seat reservation.
javascript
Copy code
app.post('/api/reserve-seats', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { eventId, seatNumbers, userId } = req.body;
    const seats = await reserveSeats(eventId, seatNumbers, userId);
    res.json({ success: true, seats });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: error.message });
  }
});
Confirm Booking: An endpoint to handle booking confirmation.
javascript
Copy code
app.post('/api/confirm-booking', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { eventId, seatNumbers, userId } = req.body;
    const booking = await confirmBooking(eventId, seatNumbers, userId);
    res.json({ success: true, booking });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: error.message });
  }
});
5. Edge Cases & Considerations
Concurrency: Ensure that multiple users cannot reserve the same seat simultaneously by using appropriate checks.
Reservation Timeout: Clearly define how long a reservation lasts and ensure the timeout is enforced.
Overbooking: Protect against overbooking by checking the seat's status immediately before finalizing the booking.
6. Scaling & Performance
Indexes: Ensure that your database is properly indexed, especially on fields like seatNumber, event, isBooked, and reservationExpiresAt.
Load Balancing: Consider load balancing if the application scales to many users making reservations simultaneously.
By following this approach, you should be able to manage reservations effectively, ensuring a smooth and reliable booking process for users.

How to cancel booking?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Canceling a booking in your event booking API involves several steps, including updating the status of the booking, freeing up the reserved or booked seats, and possibly handling any related business logic, such as refunding payments. Here's how you can implement the booking cancellation feature:

1. Booking Model Enhancement
First, ensure that your Booking model can handle cancellations by adding a status field that can represent different states, such as confirmed, pending, canceled, etc. You might already have this from the previous implementation:

typescript
Copy code
const bookingSchema = new Schema(
  {
    user: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "User",
      required: true,
    },
    event: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "Event",
      required: true,
    },
    seats: {
      type: [
        {
          type: Types.ObjectId,
          ref: "Seat",
        },
      ],
      default: [],
    },
    status: {
      type: String,
      enum: ['confirmed', 'pending', 'canceled'],
      default: 'pending',
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true },
);

export const bookingModel = model("Booking", bookingSchema);
2. Cancel Booking Function
Create a function that handles the cancellation of a booking. This function will:

Update the booking status to canceled.
Mark the associated seats as available (isBooked = false).
Clear the reservedBy field of the seats.
Handle any additional logic like refunds if necessary.
typescript
Copy code
async function cancelBooking(bookingId, userId) {
  // Find the booking by ID and ensure it belongs to the user
  const booking = await bookingModel.findOne({ _id: bookingId, user: userId });
  if (!booking) {
    throw new Error("Booking not found or you do not have permission to cancel this booking.");
  }

  // Update the booking status to 'canceled'
  booking.status = 'canceled';
  await booking.save();

  // Mark the seats as available
  await seatModel.updateMany(
    { _id: { $in: booking.seats }, isBooked: true },
    {
      isBooked: false,
      reservedBy: null,
      reservedAt: null,
      reservationExpiresAt: null,
    }
  );

  // Handle refunds or other business logic if needed
  // Example: await processRefund(booking);

  return booking;
}
3. API Endpoint for Canceling Booking
Create an API endpoint to handle booking cancellation requests.

javascript
Copy code
app.post('/api/cancel-booking', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { bookingId, userId } = req.body; // Assuming the userId comes from the session or token
    const canceledBooking = await cancelBooking(bookingId, userId);
    res.json({ success: true, booking: canceledBooking });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: error.message });
  }
});
4. Edge Cases & Considerations
Cancellation Policy: You may need to implement rules around when a booking can be canceled (e.g., not allowing cancellation within 24 hours of the event).
Refund Logic: If the user has already paid, you’ll need to handle refunds appropriately, depending on your payment gateway and business rules.
Seat Availability: After cancellation, the seats should immediately become available for other users to book.
5. Business Logic & Notifications
Notify Users: You might want to send a notification (email/SMS) to the user confirming the cancellation.
Penalties or Fees: Depending on your policy, you might apply penalties or fees for late cancellations.
6. Handling Concurrency Issues
Optimistic Locking: Consider implementing optimistic locking using version fields in Mongoose to avoid race conditions when multiple users are interacting with the same seats or booking at the same time.
typescript
Copy code
const bookingSchema = new Schema(
  {
    ...
    __v: { type: Number, select: false }, // Mongoose's internal version key
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
7. Testing the Cancel Booking Functionality
Unit Tests: Write unit tests to ensure that the cancelBooking function behaves correctly, including edge cases like trying to cancel a booking that doesn't belong to the user.
Integration Tests: Test the entire flow from booking to cancellation, including seat availability before and after the cancellation.
By following these steps, you can implement a robust cancellation feature in your event booking API, ensuring that bookings are canceled smoothly and that seats are correctly released for future bookings.

How to handle seats?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Handling seats in an event booking system involves ensuring that seats are properly managed, reserved, and booked. Here's how you can effectively manage seats in your event booking API:

1. Seat Management Basics
In your application, seats are typically tied to specific events, and users can select seats to reserve or book. Proper management ensures that:

Seats are uniquely identified within an event (e.g., seat numbers).
Seats can be reserved temporarily (while a user completes the booking process).
Seats are marked as booked once the booking is confirmed.
Seat availability is checked and updated in real-time to prevent double booking.
2. Seat Schema in Mongoose
Here’s a refined Seat schema that includes all the necessary fields for managing seats:

typescript
Copy code
import { Schema, model, Types } from 'mongoose';

const seatSchema = new Schema(
  {
    event: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'Event',
      required: true,
    },
    seatNumber: {
      type: Number,
      required: true,
    },
    reservedBy: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User',
    },
    reservedAt: {
      type: Date,
    },
    reservationExpiresAt: {
      type: Date,
    },
    isBooked: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: false,
    },
  },
  {
    timestamps: true,
    unique: ['event', 'seatNumber'], // Ensure that seat numbers are unique per event
  }
);

const seatModel = model('Seat', seatSchema);
export { seatModel };
3. Seat Reservation Logic
When a user selects seats, the seats should be reserved temporarily. Here's how you can implement seat reservation:

typescript
Copy code
async function reserveSeats(eventId, seatNumbers, userId, reservationDuration = 10 * 60 * 1000) {
  const now = new Date();
  const expiresAt = new Date(now.getTime() + reservationDuration);

  const seats = await seatModel.find({
    event: eventId,
    seatNumber: { $in: seatNumbers },
    isBooked: false,
    $or: [
      { reservedAt: { $exists: false } },
      { reservationExpiresAt: { $lt: now } },
    ],
  });

  if (seats.length !== seatNumbers.length) {
    throw new Error("Some seats are already reserved or booked.");
  }

  await seatModel.updateMany(
    { _id: { $in: seats.map(seat => seat._id) } },
    {
      reservedBy: userId,
      reservedAt: now,
      reservationExpiresAt: expiresAt,
    }
  );

  return seats;
}
4. Booking Confirmation
Once the user completes the booking, the system should confirm the booking by marking the seats as booked:

typescript
Copy code
async function confirmBooking(eventId, seatNumbers, userId) {
  const now = new Date();

  const seats = await seatModel.find({
    event: eventId,
    seatNumber: { $in: seatNumbers },
    reservedBy: userId,
    reservationExpiresAt: { $gt: now },
    isBooked: false,
  });

  if (seats.length !== seatNumbers.length) {
    throw new Error("Some seats are no longer available.");
  }

  await seatModel.updateMany(
    { _id: { $in: seats.map(seat => seat._id) } },
    {
      isBooked: true,
      reservedBy: null,
      reservedAt: null,
      reservationExpiresAt: null,
    }
  );

  const booking = new bookingModel({
    user: userId,
    event: eventId,
    seats: seats.map(seat => seat._id),
    status: 'confirmed',
  });

  await booking.save();

  return booking;
}
5. Canceling a Booking
If a user decides to cancel a booking, the seats should be made available again:

typescript
Copy code
async function cancelBooking(bookingId, userId) {
  const booking = await bookingModel.findOne({ _id: bookingId, user: userId });
  if (!booking) {
    throw new Error("Booking not found or you do not have permission to cancel this booking.");
  }

  booking.status = 'canceled';
  await booking.save();

  await seatModel.updateMany(
    { _id: { $in: booking.seats }, isBooked: true },
    {
      isBooked: false,
      reservedBy: null,
      reservedAt: null,
      reservationExpiresAt: null,
    }
  );

  return booking;
}
6. Handling Seat Availability
You need to ensure that seats are not double-booked and are released when reservations expire. This involves:

Checking seat availability before reserving or booking.
Clearing expired reservations periodically.
Here’s how you can clear expired reservations:

typescript
Copy code
async function clearExpiredReservations() {
  const now = new Date();

  await seatModel.updateMany(
    { reservationExpiresAt: { $lt: now }, isBooked: false },
    {
      reservedBy: null,
      reservedAt: null,
      reservationExpiresAt: null,
    }
  );
}

// Call this function periodically, e.g., every minute
setInterval(clearExpiredReservations, 60 * 1000);
7. API Endpoints for Seat Management
1. Reserve Seats Endpoint
javascript
Copy code
app.post('/api/reserve-seats', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { eventId, seatNumbers, userId } = req.body;
    const seats = await reserveSeats(eventId, seatNumbers, userId);
    res.json({ success: true, seats });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: error.message });
  }
});
2. Confirm Booking Endpoint
javascript
Copy code
app.post('/api/confirm-booking', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { eventId, seatNumbers, userId } = req.body;
    const booking = await confirmBooking(eventId, seatNumbers, userId);
    res.json({ success: true, booking });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: error.message });
  }
});
3. Cancel Booking Endpoint
javascript
Copy code
app.post('/api/cancel-booking', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { bookingId, userId } = req.body;
    const canceledBooking = await cancelBooking(bookingId, userId);
    res.json({ success: true, booking: canceledBooking });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: error.message });
  }
});
8. Handling Concurrency
Concurrency issues can arise when multiple users try to reserve the same seat simultaneously. To mitigate this:

Use atomic operations (like Mongoose's findOneAndUpdate) to check and update seat availability in a single step.
Consider optimistic locking using Mongoose's __v field.
9. Testing and Validation
Unit Tests: Write tests to ensure that seat reservation, booking, and cancellation work as expected.
Integration Tests: Test the flow of selecting, reserving, booking, and canceling seats.
Stress Tests: Simulate multiple users booking the same event to ensure the system handles concurrency correctly.
By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage seat reservations, bookings, and cancellations in your event booking API, ensuring a smooth and reliable user experience.

To update seats in your event booking system, you typically need to support operations like modifying seat details, marking seats as available or unavailable, and handling seat reassignments. Below are steps and examples for updating seats:

1. Seat Schema Recap
Here's a reminder of the Seat schema structure for context:

typescript
Copy code
import { Schema, model } from 'mongoose';

const seatSchema = new Schema(
  {
    event: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'Event',
      required: true,
    },
    seatNumber: {
      type: Number,
      required: true,
    },
    reservedBy: {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User',
    },
    reservedAt: {
      type: Date,
    },
    reservationExpiresAt: {
      type: Date,
    },
    isBooked: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: false,
    },
  },
  {
    timestamps: true,
  }
);

const seatModel = model('Seat', seatSchema);
export {# event-booking-api
